rpd-metas are the metapackages used to create the Raspberry Pi Desktop.

There is a hierarchy of metapackages defined:

- Core packages
- Theme packages
- Optional packages

Applying all the packages below to a Lite image will produce the equivalent
of the standard Raspberry Pi Desktop image.

Core packages
=============

The package rpd-common contains the packages which are always required for
any desktop environment. This should be installed without recommended packages
for the cleanest install.

The package rpd-wayland-core contains the packages which are required for
a basic Wayland-based desktop.

The package rpd-x-core contains the packages which are required for
a basic X11-based desktop. 

Both the rpx-*-core packages depend on rpd-common, and should
be installed without recommended packages for the cleanest install.

Unless you need to switch between Wayland and X11 desktops, it should not be
necessary to install both of rpd-wayland-core and rpd-x-core.


Theme packages
==============

The package rpd-theme installs the packages which contain the look and feel
of the Raspberry Pi Desktop - the fonts, desktop pictures, icons and GTK theme.

The package rpd-preferences installs the packages which are required for
the Control Centre preferences application and all plugins. 

In both cases, the packages included are recommended installs rather than
dependencies, so these packages should be installed with recommended packages.

Both of these metapackages are compatible with both Wayland and X11 desktops.

Installing core + theme packages will give a configurable desktop with the
Raspberry Pi Desktop look and feel.


Optional packages
=================

The package rpd-utilities installs the contents of the Acccessories menu and
a few other miscellaneous utilities such as the first-run wizard.

The package rpd-applications installs the Chromium and Firefox web browsers,
the VLC media player and the programming applications Thonny and Geany.

The package rpd-developer installs various Python libraries used for code
development, and some camera development libraries, along with some more
general developer tools such as git and meson.

The package rpd-graphics installs various libraries to support graphics and
video, such as ffmpeg and gstreamer.

All of these metapackages are compatible with both Wayland and X11 desktops.
There are two additional metapackages which are specific to particular desktop
environments:

The package rpd-x-extras installs X11-specific support for screen capture and
remote desktop access.

The package rpd-wayland-extras installs X11-specific support for screen capture and
remote desktop access.

In all cases, the packages included are recommended installs rather than
dependencies, so these packages should be installed with recommended packages.
